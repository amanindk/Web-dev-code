        am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many
        things I like to do, to see, and to experience.</del

      I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like
      to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning,

    <p style="font-family: arial">
      I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on
      my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at
      the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment
      when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring,
      rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep
      early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded
      by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the
      beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign.
